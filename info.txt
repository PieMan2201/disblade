DISBLADE 

---GRID MECHANICS---
-STORAGE
All operations are on an execution grid.
The size of this grid can be expanded to suit the needs of the program, and is defined at the beginning of execution.
Multiplication operates left>right, addition goes up>down.
Operations are carried out when the grid is updated, going down each column.

-DISPLAY
There exists another grid of variable size, designed for user-readable output.
No operations occur on this grid.
The display grid can be modified during execution, but these modifications will not be shown until it is updated.

---DATA TYPES---
All numbers are reated as floating points. Conversion is done in the interpreter for certain tasks (e.g indices)
There is no boolean type. Equalities are equivalent to true, and inequalites false.

---EXECUTION---
One must use the EVALUATE command to execute applied commands.
No operations occur on the execution grid until the command is called on said grid.
No output is displayed until the command is called on the display.
The EVALUATE statement essentially updated the specified grid.

---CONDITIONALS---
Conditions exist where needed in the form "(x=y)"
WHL(){} is used for while loops, where () is the condition and {} is the code.
DLY is used to pause execution for a specified amount of time (deciseconds). Use as drain of "from".
IF(){} is used for if statements. Usage is the same as WHL.

---MISCELLANEOUS---
Lines can be commented out by prefacing them with a "~". 
Any line beginning with this character will not be executed.
Indentation does not matter.
All commands must end with a newline.
The recommended filename extension is ".dsb", though the interpreter will accept any plaintext file.
